[Public Diplomacy in Other Words](https://pdother.netlify.app/) - I am currently involved in a cross-cultural project that brings together scholars from various universities across multiple countries. The main objective of our project is to examine public diplomacy scholarship across different languages. Within the project, I have taken the lead in the Spanish-language team. We employ computational text analysis to conduct a content analysis of Spanish-language peer-reviewed articles on public diplomacy from 2001 onwards. Our paper is forthcoming in the <i>Journal of Public Diplomacy</i>.

[Military DIME (M-DIME) Research Project](https://fmso.tradoc.army.mil/military-dime-m-dime-research-project/) - In Fall 2023, I was a Research Fellow at the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Commandâ€™s Foreign Military Studies Office (FMSO). FMSO provides military and government leaders with a clear, comparative understanding of how China and Russia employ instruments of national power to obtain military influence around the world. My tasks focused on conducting open-source research and analysis on Chinese and Russian military influence in Latin America.	I wrote reports and delivered presentations to military and civilian leaders in the U.S. Department of Defense. You can find my reports tracking Chinese and Russian activities abroad [HERE](https://fmso.tradoc.army.mil/military-dime-m-dime-research-project/).

I have served as the instructor of record for an undergraduate course in international relations and a course on quantitative social science research methods. Additionally, I have given guest lectures on topics such as Chinese politics, computational social science, international political economy, and text-as-data methods. I have also worked as a teaching assistant for multiple courses.

  - <b>Primary substantive expertise</b>: Chinese Foreign Policy, Diplomacy, Social Media and Politics, U.S.-China Relations, International Political Economy, Introduction to Comparative Politics

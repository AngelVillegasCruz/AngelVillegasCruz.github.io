Hello! I am a Senior Institutional Research Analyst in the Office of Data Insights and Reporting at the University of Rochester. I gather and analyze complex data about students, academic programs, and other aspects of the university, providing reports and visualizations that support data-informed decision-making by campus leaders.

In general, I specialize in advanced statistical techniques for applied research, including data mining, experimental design, panel data analysis, regression analysis, text-as-data methods, and time series analysis, among others. I am proficient in R, Python, Tableau, and other tools, with extensive experience cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing complex datasets.

I hold a dual-title Ph.D. in Political Science and Asian Studies from the Pennsylvania State University.

My academic research explores how countries leverage digital technologies, particularly social media, to advance their foreign policy goals. My regional expertise spans East Asia, especially China, and Latin America. Methodologically, I focus on quantitative analysis, computational social science, text analysis, survey experiments, and digital humanities.

My peer-reviewed articles have been published in <i> Foreign Policy Analysis, Journal of East Asian Studies, Journal of Public Diplomacy, Political Communication, Revista [IN]Genios, South African Journal of International Affairs, The Hague Journal of Diplomacy</i>, among others.

I also hold an M.A. in Political Science from the Pennsylvania State University with specializations in International Relations and Comparative Politics. Prior to attending Penn State, I studied Mandarin Chinese for two years in Beijing and obtained an M.A. in International Relations from Beijing Normal University (北京师范大学). I completed my B.A. in Sociology from the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus.

Please view my research projects and other pages for more information about my work, or feel free to contact me via email [(angel.villegas.upr@gmail.com)](mailto:angel.villegas.upr@gmail.com).

My substantive research interests include international affairs, public diplomacy, foreign policy, social media, and international political economy.

My teaching interests are closely related to my research, and I believe they mutually benefit each other. I am interested in teaching substantive courses in international relations, comparative politics, diplomacy, Chinese foreign policy, Chinese politics, social media and politics, U.S.-China relations, and international political economy. Additionally, I am interested in teaching courses on social science research methods, with a particular focus on quantitative analysis, text-as-data methods, and survey design and analysis.>

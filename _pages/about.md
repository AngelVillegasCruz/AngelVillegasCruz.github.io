Hello! I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at Pennsylvania State University. I am pursuing a dual-title Ph.D. in Political Science and Asian Studies. I received my M.A. in Political Science from the Pennsylvania State University in May of 2021 with specializations in International Relations and Comparative Politics.

My dissertation is about how countries use social media to conduct public diplomacy and what are the potential effects of online diplomatic messages. My research interests also include Chinese foreign policy, social media, Sino-American relations, and international political economy. Methodologically, I am interested in quantitative political science, text analysis, survey experiments, and digital humanities.

Prior to attending Penn State, I received an M.A. in International Relations from Beijing Normal University and a B.A. in Sociology from the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus.

My pronouns are he/his/him. Please view my CV, Research, and Teaching pages for more information about my work, or feel free to contact me via email.

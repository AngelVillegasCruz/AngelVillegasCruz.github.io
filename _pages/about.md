Hello! I am a third-year Ph.D. student at Pennsylvania State University. I am pursuing a dual-title Ph.D. in Political Science and Asian Studies. My major field is International Relations, while my minor field is Comparative Politics.

Prior to attending Penn State, I received an M.A. in International Relations from Beijing Normal University and a B.A. in Sociology from the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus.

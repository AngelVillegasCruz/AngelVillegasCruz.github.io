Hello! I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at Pennsylvania State University. I am pursuing a dual-title Ph.D. in Political Science and Asian Studies. I received my M.A. in Political Science from the Pennsylvania State University in May of 2021 with primary fields of International Relations and Comparative Politics.

Prior to attending Penn State, I received an M.A. in International Relations from Beijing Normal University and a B.A. in Sociology from the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus.
